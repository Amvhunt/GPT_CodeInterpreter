📢 **Announcement!**

> � **I'm thrilled to announce that our open-source project now has its own reverse endpoint. We invite everyone to join the testing phase. Once testing stabilizes, we will open-source the corresponding stable features into this project.**

�🌐 **Website**: [https://web.chatboxapp.xyz/](https://web.chatboxapp.xyz/)
   - 🖱️ Click the settings button in the bottom right corner
   - 🧠 Select "OPENAI API" as the AI Model Provider
   - 🔧 Change the API HOST (ensure no trailing slashes at the end)
   - 🔑 Obtain the OPENAI API KEY via [https://chat.chatify.me](https://chat.chatify.me)

Our reverse endpoint is not only supported on this website but also compatible with any applications that allow modification of the reverse endpoint, such as ChatGPT-Next-Web, etc. You can use our endpoint in the same way as you would with the official API.


🚀 **Our Reverse Endpoint Supports**:
1. 🗨️ Chatting with ChatGPT (triggers other functions, not for regular Q&A)
2. 📤 File Uploading (type '/upload'; click "CLICK TO UPLOAD")
3. 🐍 Python Code Interpreter (triggered for specific scenarios)
4. 🎨 Image Generation (testing; using stable diffusion xl and kandinsky models to generate one image each, $0.006 per generation, cost covered; seeking free alternatives)
5. 📸 Image Description (textual descriptions for images)
6. 🔍 Web Search Functionality (in testing phase)

Enjoy these exciting new features! 🎉
